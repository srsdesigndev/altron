## How It Works

![Landing How It Works](assets/landing-how-it-works.png)

1. **Select a folder** on your computer where passwords will be saved
2. **Create a master key** that encrypts your passwords
3. **Generate and save** passwords as you need them
4. **Search and copy** when logging into websites

![File Access Permission](assets/allow-file-access.png)

Your browser asks permission once to access the folder you chose.

![Encrypted Storage Diagram](assets/encrypted-passwords-local.png)

Everything is encrypted and stored locally - nothing goes online.
